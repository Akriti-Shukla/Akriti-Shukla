Hi there! I'm an aspiring Business Intelligence Data Analyst with a background in IT and over 6 years of work experience in the fast-paced telecom industry.
- My GitHub portfolio showcases data analytics projects with a strong focus on Power BI and Advanced Excel.
- From cleaning and transforming raw data to designing interactive dashboards that solve real-world business problems.
- Each project highlights key skills like DAX, Power Query, data modeling, and report automation in Excel.
- I enjoy turning messy datasets into clear, actionable insights and am actively seeking opportunities to bring these skills into a professional role.
